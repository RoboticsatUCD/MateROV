Code Style
==========
For ease of editing and consistency, the following code style rules should be followed.
Of course no one is perfect, so some mistakes will creep in; these rules are not meant to be exclusionary.

General
-------
* Use descriptive names, but not overly long.
* Single letter variables are okay if they have well-known semantics in the field.
* Try to keep lines less than column 80.
* Short functions are better.
* When editing someone else's code, adhere to their style if it is consistent in the file.

Comments
--------
* All informational comments include a space before the text.
* All unused code to be commented out does not include the space.
* All comments should be written in sentence case with punctuation.
* Inline comments may be aligned within their code section.
* In C, inline comments and commented out code should use `//`. All other comments should use `/* */`, employing block style if multiline (`*` on every line, comment delimiters on their own line).

Spacing
-------
* Indents should always use tabs, not spaces.
* Alignment should always use spaces, not tabs.
* Alignment is permitted in comments and strings only.
* No trailing or leading whitespace is permitted.
* All commas and semicolons should have spaces after them, unless they are their own line.
* Lines should not be split unless necessary.
* Line continuations should be indented once.
* No parentheses should be padded with spaces on the inside.
* Function and array parentheticals should have no leading space.
* Loop or Boolean parentheses should always have a leading space.
* Scope delimiters should start on a shared line with a leading space, but should end on their own line.
