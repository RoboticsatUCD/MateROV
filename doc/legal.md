Copyright
---------
The club uses the GPL v3 license for all of the software we write, and all of the compatibly-licensed software we adapt.

When adding a new code file, assign copyright to yourself with the line

	Copyright YEAR, FIRST LAST

If contributing nontrivial work to an existing code file, add yourself to the copyright underneath the previous authors, updating the year as necessary.
If modifying or adapting externally written software, credit the original authors and fulfill any other requirements of the original license, which must be GPL-compatible.

It is also advisable for production code to include the GPL copying permission statement boilerplate after the copyright assignment.
